## About the Studio

RenewTech Solutions is a **small, independent technology studio** building thoughtful digital products at the intersection of **engineering, design, and AI**.

We don’t chase scale for its own sake. We design systems that:
- Start lean and intentional  
- Feel polished and human  
- Scale naturally into products, platforms, or ecosystems  

Our work spans client collaborations, internal tools, educational platforms, and experimental builds—each treated as a long-term asset, not a throwaway project.

## 🌱 The RenewTech Ecosystem

RenewTech is not a single product—it’s a **connected ecosystem** of tools, platforms, and experiments that reinforce one another.

- **Interactive ROI & Decision Tools**  
  Visual calculators, dashboards, and pricing models designed for clarity and conversion

- **Client Portals & Training Platforms**  
  Secure onboarding, learning, and admin systems built to grow with organizations

- **Education & STEM Products**  
  NGSS-aligned labs, digital resources, and learning experiences

- **Design Systems & UI Kits**  
  Reusable components, animation patterns, and layout systems

- **Experimental Labs**  
  R&D projects, visualization experiments, and exploratory engineering

Some projects are production-ready. Others are works-in-progress or internal explorations. All are built with intent.
