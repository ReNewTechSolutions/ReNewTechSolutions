## ✨ About the Studio

RenewTech Solutions is a **small, independent technology studio** building thoughtful digital products at the intersection of **engineering, design, and AI**.

We don’t chase scale for its own sake. We design systems that:
- Start lean and intentional  
- Feel polished and human  
- Scale naturally into products, platforms, or ecosystems  

Our work spans client collaborations, internal tools, educational platforms, and experimental builds—each treated as a long-term asset, not a throwaway project.
